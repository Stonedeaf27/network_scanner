# Network Vulnerability Scanning Tool

## Introduction

The Network Vulnerability Scanning Tool is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in a network or website. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Scanning Open Ports**: Identifies open ports on the target.
2. **Checking for Outdated Software Versions**: Checks if the software version in use has known vulnerabilities.
3. **Identifying Weak Passwords**: Determines if a given password is commonly used and weak.
4. **Integrating with a Database of Known Vulnerabilities (CVE Database)**: Uses the CVE database to check for known vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `socket`
  - `requests`
  - `concurrent.futures`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `network_scanner.py` file.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python network_scanner.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the target IP address or hostname.
   - Enter the software name and version to check for vulnerabilities.
   - Enter a password to check for weakness.

## Functions

### scan_open_ports(target, ports)

Scans the target for open ports within the specified range.

### check_software_version(software, version)

Checks the specified software version against the CVE database for known vulnerabilities.

### identify_weak_password(password)

Identifies if the provided password is weak based on a predefined list of common weak passwords.

## Example

```bash
Enter the target IP address or hostname: 127.0.0.1
Scanning for open ports...
Open ports found: [22, 80, 443]
Enter the software name to check for vulnerabilities: apache
Enter the software version: 2.4.49
Checking for known vulnerabilities...
Vulnerabilities found for apache version 2.4.49:
CVE ID: CVE-2021-XXXX, Summary: Description of the vulnerability.
Enter a password to check for weakness: password
The password is weak!
```
